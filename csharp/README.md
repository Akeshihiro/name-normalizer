The C# version of the name-normalizer is in place. It uses xUnit.NET and FluentAssertions.

I believe the project is currently on .NET 4.5.2, and should run against C# 5.0 or higher. I've not bother upgrading in a while, and thus there are no tuples (7.0?) here; they might've proved reasonably useful.
